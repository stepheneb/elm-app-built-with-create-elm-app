Create a new Elm App using [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

Install `create-elm-app` globally:

```
% npm install create-elm-app -g
+ create-elm-app@3.0.6
added 1561 packages from 719 contributors in 485.994s
```
This install took about eight minutes on the internal thoughtbot network
and installed 1561 packages!

Generate the initial app.

```
% create-elm-app elm-create-elm-app-app1

Creating elm-create-elm-app-app1 project...

Dependencies ready!
Success! Compiled 1 module.

Project is successfully created in `/Users/stephen/dev/elm/sandbox/elm-create-elm-app-app1`.

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  elm-app start
    Starts the development server.

  elm-app build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  elm-app test
    Starts the test runner.

  elm-app eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd elm-create-elm-app-app1
  elm-app start
```


OK ...

```
% cd elm-create-elm-app-app1
% elm-app start
```

Running the `start` command started app and opened Chrome to: http://localhost:3000/

Changes to Elm code are hot-reloaded into browser.
